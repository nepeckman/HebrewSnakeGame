# HebrewSnakeGame

# Project Summery
This game is a simple snake styled game created to teach Hebrew letters to children. The goal is to collect all the Hebrew letters in order, without running into the "tail" or the walls. The next letter is printed above the field, and the student is presented with several letters on the field. The student must select the correct letter to add it to the snake and progress through the game. I utilize this game consistently in a classroom setting.

# Project Context
I created this game over the course of my Introduction to Computer Science class in Spring 2015. As I learned about concepts in class (such as abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance) I refactored my code in an attempt to implement that concept. The code got progressively better as the class continued, and the game eventually got to an acceptable state.

# Lessons
Through this project, I reinforced the concepts I learned in class. As my introductory class continued, the C# language made more sense to me, and I understood how to implement basic code style. Those styles didn't always mesh perfectly with the conventions of the Unity engine, but I was able to get them to work together well enough for this simple game. This game was great practice and a fun way to apply the concepts I learned.
